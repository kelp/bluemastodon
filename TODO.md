# Social-Sync Implementation Plan

## Scope Clarification
This tool specifically handles synchronizing manual posts from Bluesky to Mastodon. A separate tool in the blog repository will handle publishing blog posts to social platforms.

## 1. Project Setup (Day 1)
- [x] Define architecture and coding standards
- [ ] Initialize project structure
- [ ] Set up virtual environment
- [ ] Configure pyproject.toml with dependencies
- [ ] Add .gitignore
- [ ] Configure pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Set up basic GitHub Actions workflow

## 2. API Research (Day 1-2)
- [ ] Research Bluesky API authentication and endpoints
- [ ] Research Mastodon API authentication and endpoints
- [ ] Document required API credentials and how to obtain them
- [ ] Plan data models for posts and interaction mapping

## 3. Core Implementation (Day 2-4)
- [ ] Implement config.py for loading secrets and settings
- [ ] Implement models.py with data classes for posts
- [ ] Implement bluesky.py client
  - [ ] Authentication
  - [ ] Fetching recent posts
  - [ ] Handling post content and media
- [ ] Implement mastodon.py client
  - [ ] Authentication
  - [ ] Creating posts
  - [ ] Handling media uploads
- [ ] Implement sync.py for orchestration
  - [ ] Post mapping logic
  - [ ] Cross-posting workflow
  - [ ] State tracking to avoid duplicates

## 4. Testing (Day 4-5)
- [ ] Write unit tests for each module
- [ ] Set up mock API responses
- [ ] Create integration tests
- [ ] Ensure 100% test coverage
- [ ] Add test for edge cases (rate limits, API errors, etc.)

## 5. GitHub Actions Setup (Day 6)
- [ ] Create workflow for running tests and linters
- [ ] Set up scheduled job for cross-posting
- [ ] Configure secrets management
- [ ] Add manual trigger option
- [ ] Test the complete workflow

## 6. Documentation and Finalization (Day 7)
- [ ] Complete docstrings for all modules and functions
- [ ] Generate and review pydoc documentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive README with setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Add examples and troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Final code review and quality check

## 7. Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add support for images and other media types
- [ ] Implement bi-directional sync
- [ ] Add support for replies and interactions
- [ ] Create a simple dashboard for monitoring
- [ ] Consider support for other platforms (Twitter, etc.)
- [ ] Add deduplication mechanism to avoid duplicate posts if blog publisher also posts to both platforms
